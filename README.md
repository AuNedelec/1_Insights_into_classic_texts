# Project 1 : Insights into Classic Texts (and Nicki Minaj)

This project was realized within [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)'s course  [Apply Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/natural-language-processing).
The code is available both as a Jupyther Notebook and as a Python script for better accessibility and clarity.

## Key notions
- Text preprocessing
- Word tokenization and Word Lemmatization
- Natural Language Parsing with regular expressions
- NLTK

## Project overview
- Conduct a natural language parsing analysis to delve deeper into Homer's *The Iliad*. 
- Uncover the main topics of discussion within the novel and begin to decipher some of the authorâ€™s thoughts and beliefs embedded within the text.

## Personal touch
I was curious about the limits of this way of parsing a text, so I decided to replace Homer's classic by Nicki Minaj's classic *Chun-Li*. The purpose of this experiment was to observe :
- How this script for natural language parsing performs on a shorter text.
- How the script deals with slang words, abbreviations and interjections.
- Compare the syntactic structure of a classical text with a very modern one.
- If we could identify some deep hidden philosophical meaning within the song.
